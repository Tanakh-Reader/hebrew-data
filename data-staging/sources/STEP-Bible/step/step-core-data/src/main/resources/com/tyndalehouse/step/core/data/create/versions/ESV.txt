    <h3>Preface to the English Standard Version</h3>
    <h2>The Bible</h2>
    <p>“This Book [is] the most valuable thing that this world affords. Here is Wisdom; this is the royal Law; these are the lively Oracles of God.” With these words the Moderator of the Church of Scotland hands a Bible to the new monarch in Britain’s coronation service. These words echo the King James Bible translators, who wrote in 1611: “God’s sacred Word . . . is that inestimable treasure that excelleth all the riches of the earth.” This assessment of the Bible is the motivating force behind the publication of the English Standard Version (2011 ESV).</p>
    <h2>Translation Legacy</h2>
    <p>The English Standard Version (2011 ESV) stands in the classic mainstream of English Bible translations over the past half-millennium. The fountainhead of that stream was William Tyndale’s New Testament of 1526; marking its course were the King James Version of 1611 (KJV), the English Revised Version of 1885 (RV), the American Standard Version of 1901 (ASV), and the Revised Standard Version of 1952 and 1971 (RSV). In that stream, faithfulness to the text and vigorous pursuit of accuracy were combined with simplicity, beauty, and dignity of expression. Our goal has been to carry forward this legacy for a new century.</p>
    <p>To this end each word and phrase in the ESV has been carefully weighed against the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek, to ensure the fullest accuracy and clarity and to avoid under-translating or overlooking any nuance of the original text. The words and phrases themselves grow out of the Tyndale–King James legacy, and most recently out of the RSV, with the 1971 RSV text providing the starting point for our work. Archaic language has been brought to current usage and significant corrections have been made in the translation of key texts. But throughout, our goal has been to retain the depth of meaning and enduring language that have made their indelible mark on the English-speaking world and have defined the life and doctrine of the church over the last four centuries.</p>
    <h2>Translation Philosophy</h2>
    <p>The ESV is an “essentially literal” translation that seeks as far as possible to capture the precise wording of the original text and the personal style of each Bible writer. As such, its emphasis is on “word-for-word” correspondence, at the same time taking into account differences of grammar, syntax, and idiom between current literary English and the original languages. Thus it seeks to be transparent to the original text, letting the reader see as directly as possible the structure and meaning of the original.</p>
    <p>In contrast to the ESV, some Bible versions have followed a “thought-for-thought” rather than “word-for-word” translation philosophy, emphasizing “dynamic equivalence” rather than the “essentially literal” meaning of the original. A “thought-for-thought” translation is of necessity more inclined to reflect the interpretive opinions of the translator and the influences of contemporary culture.</p>
    <p>Every translation is at many points a trade-off between literal precision and readability, between “formal equivalence” in expression and “functional equivalence” in communication, and the ESV is no exception. Within this framework we have sought to be “as literal as possible” while maintaining clarity of expression and literary excellence. Therefore, to the extent that plain English permits and the meaning in each case allows, we have sought to use the same English word for important recurring words in the original; and, as far as grammar and syntax allow, we have rendered Old Testament passages cited in the New in ways that show their correspondence. Thus in each of these areas, as well as throughout the Bible as a whole, we have sought to capture the echoes and overtones of meaning that are so abundantly present in the original texts.</p>
    <p>As an essentially literal translation, then, the ESV seeks to carry over every possible nuance of meaning in the original words of Scripture into our own language. As such, it is ideally suited for in-depth study of the Bible. Indeed, with its emphasis on literary excellence, the ESV is equally suited for public reading and preaching, for private reading and reflection, for both academic and devotional study, and for Scripture memorization.</p>
    <h2>Translation Style</h2>
    <p>The ESV also carries forward classic translation principles in its literary style. Accordingly it retains theological terminology—words such as grace, faith, justification, sanctification, redemption, regeneration, reconciliation, propitiation—because of their central importance for Christian doctrine and also because the underlying Greek words were already becoming key words and technical terms in New Testament times.</p>
    <p>The ESV lets the stylistic variety of the biblical writers fully express itself—from the exalted prose that opens Genesis, to the flowing narratives of the historical books, to the rich metaphors and dramatic imagery of the poetic books, to the ringing rhetorical indictments in the prophetic books, to the smooth elegance of Luke, to the profound simplicities of John, and the closely reasoned logic of Paul.</p>
    <p>In punctuating, paragraphing, dividing long sentences, and rendering connectives, the ESV follows the path that seems to make the ongoing flow of thought clearest in English. The biblical languages regularly connect sentences by frequent repetition of words such as “and,” “but,” and “for,” in a way that goes beyond the conventions of literary English. Effective translation, however, requires that these links in the original be reproduced so that the flow of the argument will be transparent to the reader. We have therefore normally translated these connectives, though occasionally we have varied the rendering by using alternatives (such as “also,” “however,” “now,” “so,” “then,” or “thus”) when they better capture the sense in specific instances.</p>
    <p>In the area of gender language, the goal of the ESV is to render literally what is in the original. For example, “anyone” replaces “any man” where there is no word corresponding to “man” in the original languages, and “people” rather than “men” is regularly used where the original languages refer to both men and women. But the words “man” and “men” are retained where a male meaning component is part of the original Greek or Hebrew. Likewise, the word “man” has been retained where the original text intends to convey a clear contrast between “God” on the one hand and “man” on the other hand, with “man” being used in the collective sense of the whole human race (see <a href="http://www.esvonline.org/Luke+2.52" class="esvBibleRef" target="_blank" id="BibleRef-13">Luke 2:52</a>). Similarly, the English word “brothers” (translating the Greek word <em>adelphoi</em>) is retained as an important familial form of address between fellow-Jews and fellow-Christians in the first century. A recurring note is included to indicate that the term “brothers” (<em>adelphoi</em>) was often used in Greek to refer to both men and women, and to indicate the specific instances in the text where this is the case. In addition, the English word “sons” (translating the Greek word <em>huioi</em>) is retained in specific instances because the underlying Greek term usually includes a male meaning component and it was used as a legal term in the adoption and inheritance laws of first-century Rome. As used by the apostle Paul, this term refers to the status of all Christians, both men and women, who, having been adopted into God’s family, now enjoy all the privileges, obligations, and inheritance rights of God’s children.</p>
    <p>The inclusive use of the generic “he” has also regularly been retained, because this is consistent with similar usage in the original languages and because an essentially literal translation would be impossible without it. Similarly, where God and man are compared or contrasted in the original, the ESV retains the generic use of “man” as the clearest way to express the contrast within the framework of essentially literal translation.</p>
    <p>In each case the objective has been transparency to the original text, allowing the reader to understand the original on its own terms rather than on the terms of our present-day culture.</p>
    <h2>The Translation of Specialized Terms</h2>
    <p>In the translation of biblical terms referring to God, the ESV takes great care to convey the specific nuances of meaning of the original Hebrew and Greek terms. First, concerning terms that refer to God in the Old Testament: God, the Maker of heaven and earth, introduced himself to the people of Israel with the special, personal name, whose consonants are YHWH (see <a href="http://www.esvonline.org/Exodus+3.14-15" class="esvBibleRef" target="_blank" id="BibleRef-12">Exodus 3:14-15</a>). Scholars call this the “Tetragrammaton,” a Greek term referring to the four Hebrew letters YHWH. The exact pronunciation of YHWH is uncertain, because the Jewish people considered the personal name of God to be so holy that it should never be spoken aloud. Instead of reading the word YHWH, they would normally read the Hebrew word <em>adonai</em> (“Lord”), and the ancient translations into Greek, Syriac, and Aramaic also followed suit. When the vowels of the word <em>adonai</em> are placed with the consonants of YHWH, this results in the familiar word <em>Jehovah</em> that was used in some earlier English Bible translations. As is common among English translations today, the ESV usually renders the personal name of God (YHWH) with the word <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> (printed in small capitals). An exception to this is when the Hebrew word adonai appears together with YHWH, in which case the two words are rendered together as “the Lord [in lower case] <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">God</span> [in small capitals].” In contrast to the personal name for God (YHWH), the more general name for God in Old Testament Hebrew is ‘<em>elohim</em> and its related forms of ‘<em>el</em> or ‘<em>eloah</em>, all of which are normally translated “God” (in lower case letters). The use of these different ways to translate the Hebrew words for God is especially beneficial to the English reader, enabling the reader to see and understand the different ways that the <em>personal name</em> and the <em>general name</em> for God are both used to refer to the <em>One True God</em> of the Old Testament.</p>
    <p>Second, in the New Testament, the Greek word <em>Christos</em> has been translated consistently as “Christ.” Although the term originally meant “anointed,” among Jews in New Testament times the term came to designate the Messiah, the great Savior that God had promised to raise up. In other New Testament contexts, however, especially among Gentiles, <em>Christos</em> (“Christ”) was on its way to becoming a proper name. It is important, therefore, to keep the context in mind in understanding the various ways that <em>Christos</em> (“Christ”) is used in the New Testament. At the same time, in accord with its “essentially literal” translation philosophy, the ESV has retained consistency and concordance in the translation of <em>Christos</em> (“Christ”) throughout the New Testament.</p>
    <p>A third specialized term, the word “behold,” usually has been retained as the most common translation for the Hebrew word <em>hinneh</em> and the Greek word <em>idou</em>. Both of these words mean something like “Pay careful attention to what follows! This is important!” Other than the word “behold,” there is no single word in English that fits well in most contexts. Although “Look!” and “See!” and “Listen!” would be workable in some contexts, in many others these words lack sufficient weight and dignity. Given the principles of “essentially literal” translation, it is important not to leave <em>hinneh</em> and <em>idou</em> completely untranslated, and so to lose the intended emphasis in the original languages. The older and more formal word “behold” has usually been retained, therefore, as the best available option for conveying the original sense of meaning.</p>
    <h2>Textual Basis</h2>
    <p>The ESV is based on the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Bible as found in <em>Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia</em> (2nd ed., 1983), and on the Greek text in the 1993 editions of the <em>Greek New Testament</em> (4th corrected ed.), published by the United Bible Societies (UBS), and <em>Novum Testamentum Graece</em> (27th ed.), edited by Nestle and Aland. The currently renewed respect among Old Testament scholars for the Masoretic text is reflected in the ESV’s attempt, wherever possible, to translate difficult Hebrew passages as they stand in the Masoretic text rather than resorting to emendations or to finding an alternative reading in the ancient versions. In exceptional, difficult cases, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Septuagint, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Syriac Peshitta, the Latin Vulgate, and other sources were consulted to shed possible light on the text, or, if necessary, to support a divergence from the Masoretic text. Similarly, in a few difficult cases in the New Testament, the ESV has followed a Greek text different from the text given preference in the UBS/Nestle-Aland 27th edition. In this regard the footnotes that accompany the ESV text are an integral part of the ESV translation, informing the reader of textual variations and difficulties and showing how these have been resolved by the ESV translation team. In addition to this, the footnotes indicate significant alternative readings and occasionally provide an explanation for technical terms or for a difficult reading in the text. Throughout, the translation team has benefited greatly from the massive textual resources that have become readily available recently, from new insights into biblical laws and culture, and from current advances in Hebrew and Greek lexicography and grammatical understanding.</p>
    <h2>Publishing Team</h2>
    <p>The ESV publishing team includes more than a hundred people. The fourteen-member <a href="http://www.esv.org/translation/committee">Translation Oversight Committee</a> has benefited from the work of fifty biblical experts serving as <a href="http://www.esv.org/translation/team">Translation Review Scholars</a> and from the comments of the more than fifty members of the <a href="http://www.esv.org/translation/council">Advisory Council</a>, all of which has been carried out under the auspices of the Good News Publishers Board of Directors. This hundred-member team, which shares a common commitment to the truth of God’s Word and to historic Christian orthodoxy, is international in scope and includes leaders in many denominations.</p>
    <h2>To God’s Honor and Praise</h2>
    <p>We know that no Bible translation is perfect or final; but we also know that God uses imperfect and inadequate things to his honor and praise. So to our triune God and to his people we offer what we have done, with our prayers that it may prove useful, with gratitude for much help given, and with ongoing wonder that our God should ever have entrusted to us so momentous a task.</p>

    <h1>Explanation Of the Features Included In This Edition</h1>
    <p>The Online Edition of the ESV Bible includes a number of valuable features to encourage the reading and study of the Bible. A brief description is provided below explaining the purpose and use of these features.</p>
    <h2>Section Headings</h2>
    <p>Section headings have been included throughout the text of the ESV Online Edition. While the headings are not part of the Bible text itself, they have been provided to help identify and locate important themes and topics throughout the Bible.</p>
    <h2>Textual Footnotes</h2>
    <p>Several kinds of footnotes related to the ESV text are provided throughout the ESV Bible to assist the reader. These footnotes appear at the bottom of the page and are indicated in the ESV text by a superscript <em>number</em> that <em>follows</em> the word or phrase to which the footnote applies (e.g., “Isaac<span style="color: #ccc;">“).</span></p>
    <p>The footnotes included in the ESV Bible are an integral part of the text and provide important information concerning the understanding and translation of the text. The footnotes fall mainly into four categories, as illustrated in the examples below.</p>
    <h2>Types of Textual Footnotes</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Alternative Translations</strong>. Footnotes of this kind provide alternative translations for specific words or phrases when there is a strong possibility that such words or phrases could be translated in another way, such as: “Or <em>keep awake</em>” (see <a href="http://www.esvonline.org/Matt.+26.38" class="esvBibleRef" target="_blank" id="BibleRef-11">Matt. 26:38</a>); and “Or <em>down payment</em>” (see <a href="http://www.esvonline.org/Eph.+1.14" class="esvBibleRef" target="_blank" id="BibleRef-10">Eph. 1:14</a>). In such cases, the translation deemed to have the stronger support is in the text while other possible renderings are given in the note.</li>
        <li><strong>Explanation of Greek and Hebrew Terms</strong>. Notes of this kind relate primarily to the meaning of specific Greek or Hebrew terms, as illustrated by the following examples:
            <ol>
                <li>Notes about the meaning of names in the original languages, such as: “Isaac means <em>he laughs</em>” (see <a href="http://www.esvonline.org/Gen.+17.19" class="esvBibleRef" target="_blank" id="BibleRef-9">Gen. 17:19</a>); and “<em>Simeon</em> sounds like the Hebrew for <em>heard</em>” (see <a href="http://www.esvonline.org/Gen.+29.33" class="esvBibleRef" target="_blank" id="BibleRef-8">Gen. 29:33</a>).</li>
                <li>Notes that give the literal translation of a Greek or Hebrew word or phrase deemed too awkward to be used in the English text, such as: “Greek <em>girding up the loins of your mind</em>” (see <a href="http://www.esvonline.org/1+Pet.%201.13" class="esvBibleRef" target="_blank" id="BibleRef-7">1 Pet. 1:13</a>).</li>
                <li>Notes indicating that absolute certainty of the meaning of a word or phrase is not possible given our best understanding of the original language (e.g., Hebrew words occurring so infrequently in the Old Testament that their meaning cannot be determined with certainty). Such words are identified with a note stating that “The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain” (see, e.g., <a href="http://www.esvonline.org/Josh.+17.11" class="esvBibleRef" target="_blank" id="BibleRef-6">Josh. 17:11</a>).</li>
                <li>Notes that indicate the specialized use of a Greek word, such as: “brothers,” translating the Greek word <em>adelphoi</em> (see, e.g., the extended note on <a href="http://www.esvonline.org/Rom.+1.13" class="esvBibleRef" target="_blank" id="BibleRef-5">Rom. 1:13</a>, corresponding to the first occurrence of <em>adelphoi</em> in any New Testament book, and the abbreviated note, e.g., on <a href="http://www.esvonline.org/Rom.+7.1" class="esvBibleRef" target="_blank" id="BibleRef-4">Rom. 7:1</a>, corresponding to subsequent occurrences of <em>adelphoi</em> in any New Testament book); and “sons,” translating the Greek word <em>huioi</em> (see, e.g., <a href="http://www.esvonline.org/Rom.+8.14" class="esvBibleRef" target="_blank" id="BibleRef-3">Rom. 8:14</a>). See also the discussion of <em>adelphoi</em> and <em>huioi</em> in the preface.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Other Explanatory Notes</strong>. Footnotes of this kind provide clarifying information as illustrated by the following examples:
            <ol>
                <li>Notes clarifying additional meanings that may not otherwise be apparent in the text, such as: “<em>Leprosy</em> was a term for several skin diseases; see <a href="http://www.esvonline.org/Leviticus+13" class="esvBibleRef" target="_blank" id="BibleRef-2">Leviticus 13</a>.”</li>
                <li>Notes clarifying important grammatical points that would not otherwise be apparent in English, such as: “In Hebrew <em>you</em> is plural in verses 1-5″ (see <a href="http://www.esvonline.org/Gen.+3.1" class="esvBibleRef" target="_blank" id="BibleRef-1">Gen. 3:1</a>).</li>
                <li>Notes clarifying when the referent for a pronoun has been supplied in the English text, such as: “Greek <em>he</em>” (see, e.g., <a href="http://www.esvonline.org/Mark+1.43" class="esvBibleRef" target="_blank" id="BibleRef-0">Mark 1:43</a>).</li>
                <li>Notes giving English equivalents for weights, measures, and monetary values.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Technical Translation Notes</strong>. Footnotes of this kind indicate how decisions have been made in the translation of difficult Hebrew and Greek passages. Such notes occasionally include technical terms. For an explanation of these terms the reader is referred to standard Bible study reference works. See further the section in the preface on “Textual Basis” for an explanation of the original-language texts used in the translation of the ESV Bible and how the translation of difficult passages has been resolved.</li>
