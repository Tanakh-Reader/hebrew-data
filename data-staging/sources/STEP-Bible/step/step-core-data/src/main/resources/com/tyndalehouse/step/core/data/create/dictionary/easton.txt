Alpha, the first [[letter]] of the [[Greek]] alphabet, as [[Omega]] is the
last. These
letters occur in the text of [[Rev 1:8|Rev.1.8]], [[11|Rev.1.11]];
[[21:6|Rev.21.6]]; [[22:13|Rev.22.13]], and are represented [[by]] "Alpha" and
"[[Omega]]" respectively (omitted in R.V., [[1:11|Rev.1.11]]). They mean "the
first
and last." (Comp. [[Heb 12:2|Heb.12.2]]; [[Isa 41:4|Isa.41.4]];
[[44:6|Isa.44.6]]; [[Rev 1:11|Rev.1.11]], [[17|Rev.1.17]]; [[2:8|Rev.2.8]].) In
the symbols of the early [[Christian]] [[Church]] these two letters are
frequently
combined with the [[cross]] or with Christ's monogram to denote his divinity.

The eldest son of [[Amram|AMRAM (1)]] and [[Jochebed]], a [[daughter]] of
[[Levi|LEVI (1)]] ([[Exod
6:20|Exod.6.20]]). Some explain the name as meaning mountaineer, others
mountain of strength, illuminator. He was born in [[Egypt]] three years before
his
[[brother]] [[Moses]], and a number of years after his sister [[Miriam|MIRIAM
(1)]] ([[2:1|Exod.2.1]],
[[4|Exod.2.4]]; [[7:7|Exod.7.7]]). He married [[Elisheba]], the [[daughter]] of
[[Amminadab|AMMINADAB (1)]] of the [[house]] of [[Judah]] ([[6:23|Exod.6.23]];
[[1 Chr 2:10|1Chr.2.10]]),
[[by]] whom he had four sons, [[Nadab|NADAB (1)]] and [[Abihu]],
[[Eleazar|ELEAZAR (1)]] and [[Ithamar]]. When the time
for the deliverance of Isarael out of [[Egypt]] drew nigh, he was sent [[by]]
[[God]]
([[Exod 4:14|Exod.4.14]], [[27-30|Exod.4.27]]) to meet his long-absent
[[brother]],
that he might co-operate with him in all that they were required to do in
bringing about the [[Exodus]]. He was to be the "mouth" or "[[prophet]]" of
[[Moses]],
i.e., was to speak for him, because he was a [[man]] of a ready utterance
([[7:1|Exod.7.1]], [[2|Exod.7.2]], [[9|Exod.7.9]], [[10|Exod.7.10]],
[[19|Exod.7.19]]). He was [[faithful]] to his trust, and stood [[by]] [[Moses]]
in all his
interviews with [[Pharaoh]]. 

When the ransomed tribes fought their first battle with [[Amalek]] in
[[Rephidim]],
[[Moses]] stood [[on]] a [[hill]] overlooking the scene of the conflict with
the rod of [[God]]
in his outstretched [[hand]]. [[On]] this occasion he was attended [[by]] Aaron
and [[Hur|HUR (1)]],
his sister's [[husband]], who held up his wearied hands till [[Joshua]] and the
[[chosen]]
warriors of [[Israel]] gained the victory ([[17:8-13|Exod.17.8]]). 

Afterwards, when encamped before [[Sinai]], and when [[Moses]] at the command
of [[God]]
ascended the [[mount]] to receive the [[tables]] of the [[law]], Aaron and his
two sons,
[[Nadab|NADAB (1)]] and [[Abihu]], along with seventy of the elders of
[[Israel]], were permitted to
accompany him part of the way, and to behold afar off the manifestation of the
[[glory]] of Israel's [[God]] ([[Exod 19:24|Exod.19.24]];
[[24:9-11|Exod.24.9]]). While
[[Moses]] remained [[on]] the mountain with [[God]], Aaron returned unto the
people; and
yielding through fear, or ignorance, or instability of character, to their
clamour, made unto them a golden [[calf]], and set it up as an object of
[[worship]]
([[Exod 32:4|Exod.32.4]]; [[Ps 106:19|Ps.106.19]]). [[On]] the return of
[[Moses]] to
the [[camp]], Aaron was sternly rebuked [[by]] him for the part he had acted in
this
matter; but he interceded for him before [[God]], who forgave his [[sin]]
([[Deut
9:20|Deut.9.20]]). 

[[On]] the [[mount]], [[Moses]] received instructions regarding the system of
[[worship]] which
was to be set up among the people; and in accordance therewith Aaron and his
sons were consecrated to the priest's office ([[Lev 8|Lev.81]]; 9). Aaron, as
high [[priest]], held henceforth the prominent place appertaining to that
office. 

When [[Israel]] had reached [[Hazeroth]], in "the [[wilderness]] of [[Paran]],"
Aaron joined
with his sister [[Miriam|MIRIAM (1)]] in [[murmuring]] against [[Moses]],
"because of the Ethiopian
[[woman]] whom he had married," probably after the [[death]] of [[Zipporah]].
But the [[Lord]]
vindicated his servant [[Moses]], and punished [[Miriam|MIRIAM (1)]] with
[[leprosy]] ([[Num
12|Num.121]]). Aaron acknowledged his own and his sister's guilt, and at the
intercession of [[Moses]] they were forgiven. 

Twenty years after this, when the children of [[Israel]] were encamped in the
[[wilderness]] of [[Paran]], [[Korah|KORAH (1)]], [[Dathan]], and
[[Abiram|ABIRAM (1)]] conspired against Aaron and his
sons; but a fearful judgment from [[God]] fell upon them, and they were
destroyed,
and the next [[day]] [[thousands]] of the people also perished [[by]] a fierce
pestilence,
the ravages of which were only stayed [[by]] the interposition of Aaron ([[Num
16|Num.161]]). That there might be further evidence of the divine appointment
of Aaron to the priestly office, the chiefs of the tribes were each required to
bring to [[Moses]] a rod bearing [[on]] it the name of his [[tribe]]. And
these, along with
the rod of Aaron for the [[tribe]] of [[Levi|LEVI (1)]], were laid up overnight
in the
[[tabernacle]], and in the morning it was found that while the other rods
remained
unchanged, that of Aaron "for the [[house]] of [[Levi|LEVI (1)]]" budded,
blossomed, and yielded
almonds ([[Num 17:1-10|Num.17.1]]). This rod was afterwards preserved in the
[[tabernacle]] ([[Heb 9:4|Heb.9.4]]) as a memorial of the divine attestation of
his
appointment to the priesthood. 

Aaron was implicated in the [[sin]] of his [[brother]] at [[Meribah|MERIBAH
(1)]] ([[Num
20:8-13|Num.20.8]]), and [[on]] that account was not permitted to enter the
Promised Land. When the tribes arrived at [[Mount]] [[Hor|HOR (1)]], "in the
edge of the land
of [[Edom|EDOM (1)]]," at the command of [[God]] [[Moses]] led Aaron and his
son [[Eleazar|ELEAZAR (1)]] to the top
of that mountain, in the sight of all the people. There he stripped Aaron of
his priestly vestments, and put them upon [[Eleazar|ELEAZAR (1)]]; and there
Aaron died [[on]] the
top of the [[mount]], being 123 years old ([[Num 20:23-29|Num.20.23]]. Comp.
[[Deut
10:6|Deut.10.6]]; [[32:50|Deut.32.50]]), and was "gathered unto his people."
The people, "even all the [[house]] of [[Israel]]," mourned for him thirty
days. Of
Aaron's sons two survived him, [[Eleazar|ELEAZAR (1)]], whose family held the
high-priesthood
till the time of [[Eli]]; and [[Ithamar]], in whose family, beginning with
[[Eli]], the
high-priesthood was held till the time of [[Solomon]]. Aaron's other two sons
had
been struck dead ([[Lev 10:1|Lev.10.1]], [[2|Lev.10.2]]) for the daring impiety
of [[offering]] "strange [[fire]]" [[on]] the alter of [[incense]]. 

The Arabs still show with veneration the traditionary site of Aaron's [[grave]]
[[on]]
one of the two summits of [[Mount]] [[Hor|HOR (1)]], which is marked [[by]] a
Mohammedan [[chapel]].
His name is mentioned in the Koran, and there are found in the writings of the
rabbins many fabulous stories regarding him. 

He was the first anointed [[priest]]. His descendants, "the [[house]] of
Aaron,"
constituted the priesthood in general. In the time of [[David]] they were very
numerous ([[1 Chr 12:27|1Chr.12.27]]). The other branches of the [[tribe]] of
[[Levi|LEVI (1)]]
held subordinate positions in connection with the sacred office. Aaron was a
[[type]] of [[Christ]] in his official character as the high [[priest]]. His
priesthood was
a "[[shadow]] of heavenly things," and was intended to lead the people of
[[Israel]] to
look forward to the time when "another [[priest]]" would arise "after the order
of
[[Melchizedek]]" ([[Heb 6:20|Heb.6.20]]). (See [1][[MOSES]].)

The descendants of [[Aaron]], and therefore priests. [[Jehoiada|JEHOIADA (1)]],
the [[father]] of
[[Benaiah|BENAIAH (1)]], led 3,700 Aaronites as "fighting men" to the support
of [[David]] at
[[Hebron|HEBRON (1)]] ([[1 Chr 12:27|1Chr.12.27]]). [[Eleazar|ELEAZAR (1)]]

[[Destruction]], the [[Hebrew]] name (equivalent to the [[Greek]] [[Apollyon]],
i.e.,
[[destroyer]]) of "the [[angel]] of the bottomless [[pit]]" ([[Rev
9:11|Rev.9.11]]). It is
rendered "[[destruction]]" in [[Job 28:22|Job.28.22]]; [[31:12|Job.31.12]];
[[26:6|Job.26.6]]; [[Prov 15:11|Prov.15.11]]; [[27:20|Prov.27.20]]. In the last
three of these passages the Revised [[Version]] retains the word "Abaddon." We
may
regard this word as a personification of the idea of [[destruction]], or as
[[sheol]],
the realm of the dead.
